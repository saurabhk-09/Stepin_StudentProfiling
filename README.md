# Stepin_StudentProfiling

Student Profiling is designed to help and manage the daily school activities of recording and maintaining student data by automating it. It is also known as the student information system (SIS).The system is equipped with a robust set of features like adding, viewing, searching a particular student data, modifying etc. These tools help in managing the institute efficiently and accurately. In other words, it saves time, avoid loss of data, and other wastages.This application provides user friendly interface as well. The project is designed for developing the Student Information Management system whose purpose is to reduce the complexities of keeping record and documentation in the inventory management.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. **GCC erorr in windows and linux:** installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.
2. **Generation of makefile:** To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.
3. **Unity testing:** Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
